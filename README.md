## Documentation for Business Card

I wanted to make a well designed buisness card, colorful but easy to read. I made sure the site is accessable as well, when reduced motion is on the background swiched to an alt image of a still waterfall. I played around with different font settling on IBM monospacel, a simple yet fitting font. To create my mockups I first sketched them out on paper, once done I switched to illustator. I worked my magic and here we are. As far as my branding goes, I've had this artist palette branding for years, it's my signature I had to incoorporate it somehow. Directly showing an artist palette might send the wrong message so I made it into a logo with my initials.
